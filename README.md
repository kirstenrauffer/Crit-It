Crit It
==============

A web application that allows for art students to critique each others artwork. 
HTML/CSS, PHP, MySQL

###Login

Students and professors can login using an email and password.

###Experience

Professors need to create a course page, and enroll their students into the coursepage. 
This can be done by adding a student's email/studentID.

Once students are added, they are automatically enrolled in the course and the posts from this course show up on their dashboard.
Students can see all the posts from their courses, comment on these posts, and "favorite" the posts.
Students have their own profiles showing all of their posts.

Each post consists of the artwork, the course it belongs to, and a title/description.
When a intructor or TA comments on a post, their comment is highlighted to show it's heirarchy. 

Here is a video where I click around the site, where I uploaded some content already.
